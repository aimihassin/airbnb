# airbnb

This repository is meant for my data mining course's final exam (a mini-assignment-like).

There are 5 questions in total:

  + Q1. You are required to make a user-agent that will crawl the WWW (your familiar domain) to produce dataset of a particular website.
  + Q2. Draw snowflake schema diagram for the above dataset.
  + Q3. Decision Tree
  + Q4. Apriori
  + Q5. Clustering
  
  
  
I have chosen airbnb dataset in order to answer all questions above.
